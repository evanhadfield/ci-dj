# 0012. Generated pads via a spawned sa3_mlx subprocess

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-06-12
- **Deciders:** Daniel Peter

## Context

M18 adds "generate to pad": text-to-audio one-shots and bar-quantised
loops filling the M13 freeze-pad slots. The obvious engine is Stable
Audio 3's open-weight small models (Stability AI Community License),
but the reference package is unusable here: `stable-audio-tools` pins
Python `>=3.10,<3.11` against the backend's 3.13 and hard-pins
`torch==2.7.1` beside our MLX stack.

Stability ships its own Apple-Silicon port — `optimized/mlx` in the
[`stable-audio-3`](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-3)
repo (`sa3_mlx`) — pure MLX with four runtime deps (`mlx`, `numpy`,
`sentencepiece`, `huggingface_hub`), driven by a CLI that writes a
stereo 44.1 kHz 16-bit WAV trimmed to an exact float `--seconds`.
Measured on this machine (Apple M5, 16 GB, 2026-06-12, fresh process
per run, model load included):

| model | clip | wall | peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sm-sfx | 3 s | 1.30 s | 1.06 GB |
| sm-sfx | 6 s | 0.97 s | 1.45 GB |
| sm-music | 7.74 s (4 bars @ 124) | 1.12 s | 1.10 GB |
| sm-music | 30 s | 1.52 s | 1.47 GB |

Quality cleared the go/no-go by ear (both models, all four clips).
One length limit surfaced in the integration listen: **sm-music breaks
up below ~4 s** — a 3.6 s request came back garbled from the CLI and
the API alike while 7.2 s (and the probe's 7.74 s) were clean — so the
frontend floors generated-loop requests at 7 s
(`GENERATED_LOOP_MIN_SECONDS`), in whole bars when the tempo is
locked; more bars beat broken audio. Weights (~2.3 GB for sm-sfx +
sm-music + shared codec + T5Gemma) auto-download from HF into the
cache and symlink into the checkout.

Decisions needed: how the backend runs it, where the checkout lives,
and what happens when it's missing or fails.

## Decision

- **Spawn, never import.** One backend module owns the contract and
  runs `.venv/bin/python scripts/sa3_mlx.py --prompt … --dit … --out …`
  as a short-lived subprocess per generation, reading back the WAV.
  Nothing in the backend imports `sa3_mlx` code — an isolation rule
  stronger than ADR-0002's one-importer rule, available because the
  measured whole-process wall time (~1–1.5 s, load included) makes a
  resident model pointless.
- **The venv's python, not `uv run` and not `./sa3`.** `uv run` walks
  up to the checkout's *repo root* and resolves the torch project
  (measured: it built an ephemeral torch env and crashed on
  `import mlx`); the `./sa3` wrapper exists for humans and may prompt.
  The module invokes the interpreter the checkout's installer created.
- **The checkout lives outside this repo, pinned.** A small resolver
  takes the first existing of `$SA3_MLX_HOME`,
  `~/Documents/Magenta/stable-audio-3`, `~/Repos/stable-audio-3`
  (each expected to contain `optimized/mlx/.venv`). The integration is
  validated against commit `bccf5b7`; the resolver is pure and
  unit-tested.
- **Generations are serialised** behind a single-slot semaphore: peak
  RSS is ~1.5 GB transient and two decks can request at once; one at a
  time keeps worst-case memory flat next to two model workers on a
  16 GB machine, and a queued request still lands in ~3 s.
- **Absence degrades, never crashes.** No checkout → the endpoint
  answers 503 with a setup hint and the decks are untouched; a failing
  CLI → 502 with the captured stderr tail; prompt/seconds validation
  (non-blank, bounded length and duration) → 422 at the trust
  boundary.
- **Magenta is the third engine, as its own worker.** A dedicated
  render process — the deck worker loop reused verbatim; a render
  worker is a deck worker that never receives `play` — serves
  `render_clip` commands, so pads can speak the booth's own sound
  world *while both decks stream*. It spawns lazily on the first
  `/api/render` call (a resident third model, ~2 GB for `mrt2_small`,
  is only paid for by sessions that use it; the first request carries
  the model load inside its pending state) and respawns if found
  dead. Renders use a fresh generation state per clip; results travel
  a dedicated clip queue, matched to requests by id with stale
  answers discarded, and the endpoint returns a float32 WAV (IEEE
  format 3 — no quantisation between the worker and
  `decodeAudioData`). The deck workers keep their `playing` refusal
  as a safety net, but nothing routes renders at them anymore.

## Consequences

- Easier: no dependency enters the backend venv; generation memory is
  transient (nothing competes with the deck workers between runs);
  upgrading sa3_mlx is `git pull` + re-validate, not a lockfile dance.
- The subprocess spawn + model load (~0.5 s of the wall) is paid on
  every generation. Accepted: at 1–1.5 s total, a resident-model
  server is complexity without a user-visible win.
- An un-versioned upstream: the CLI flags are the contract and a
  rebase upstream can break it. Mitigated by the pinned commit, one
  owning module, and errors that name the problem.
- A session that touches the Magenta engine holds a third model
  resident (~2 GB) until shutdown. Accepted: it is lazy, and the
  alternative — borrowing a deck's worker — made generation
  availability depend on transport state, a coupling the booth could
  feel.
- First-ever generation on a fresh machine pays the HF weight
  download (~2.3 GB) inside the request timeout; the 503 setup hint
  documents pre-warming via one manual `sa3` run.
- macOS/Apple-Silicon only — already a standing assumption of this
  project (MLX deck workers).

## Alternatives considered

- **`stable-audio-tools` in the backend venv** — impossible today:
  Python `<3.11` pin against 3.13, `torch==2.7.1` beside MLX.
- **A resident generator worker (the deck-worker pattern)** — keeps
  the model warm to save ~0.5 s per run, at the cost of a supervised
  process, a command protocol, and 1+ GB held permanently. The
  measured numbers say cold spawn is fast enough.
- **Vendoring `models/defs` into our backend** — same-venv imports
  with no subprocess, but adopts ~100 KB of model code we'd have to
  maintain and re-validate against every upstream fix; the CLI surface
  is smaller than the Python one.
- **Hosted API (Stability platform / fal.ai)** — adds a key, a cost,
  and a network dependency to a deliberately local-first instrument.
