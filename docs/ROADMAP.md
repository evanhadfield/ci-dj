# magenta-dj Roadmap

A DJ interface over [Magenta RealTime 2](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime):
two locally-running model "decks" steered by text prompts, blended with a
crossfader. Architecture decisions are recorded in [`adr/`](adr/) — notably
[ADR-0002](adr/0002-browser-app-with-python-model-workers.md) (browser app,
Python model workers) and
[ADR-0003](adr/0003-frontend-audio-mixing-via-web-audio.md) (frontend mixing
via Web Audio).

Milestones are ordered by risk: each one retires the biggest remaining unknown
before building on top of it. No dates — exit criteria gate progression.

Standing assumption: the app runs on Apple Silicon machines with enough
headroom for two concurrent model instances (Pro/Max-class for two
`mrt2_base` decks). Feasibility is taken as given; buffer-health surfacing
(M2) is how a machine that falls short shows it.

## M1 — One deck, audible

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-09).** Exit criteria verified with
`backend/scripts/verify_m1.py` (full soak run waived); MRT2 API facts
recorded in [`spike-mrt2.md`](spike-mrt2.md).

**Goal:** end-to-end skeleton — model worker → WebSocket → browser playback.

Scope:

- Install `magenta-rt[mlx]` (uv), `mrt models init`; map the streaming API
  from the installed package (class/method names, chunk duration, sample
  rate, state between chunks — it is undocumented online).
- `backend/` (uv project): FastAPI controller; one deck worker process
  (`magenta_rt` MLX) supervised by the controller.
- WebSocket protocol v0: binary frames = PCM chunks; JSON frames = control
  (`play`, `stop`, `set_prompt`).
- Throwaway test page (no React yet) with an AudioWorklet ring buffer
  (retired in M2 as planned).

**Exit criteria:** continuous audio in the browser for 10+ minutes with no
underruns; a prompt change audibly takes effect at the next chunk boundary.

## M2 — Real frontend

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-09).** Exit criteria verified end-to-end in
headless Chromium (`frontend/scripts/verify_m2.mjs`): deck driven entirely
from the React UI, health row (buffer meter, underrun counter, generation
speed) live in the UI; component tests pin the underrun visibility.

**Goal:** the React app replaces the test page.

Scope:

- `frontend/` (Vite + React + TS), served by the controller in production
  mode, Vite dev server with WS proxy during development.
- Deck component: prompt input, play/stop, volume fader (GainNode).
- Buffer-health indicator per deck (fed by worker status messages + client
  ring-buffer level) — this is how generation-too-slow shows up honestly.

**Exit criteria:** one deck fully usable from the React UI; underruns are
visible in the UI rather than silent glitches.

## M3 — Two decks, crossfader, model picker

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-09).** Exit criteria verified end-to-end in
headless Chromium (`frontend/scripts/verify_m3.mjs`): both decks on
different prompts, live equal-power crossfade, deck b switched
`mrt2_small` → `mrt2_base` while deck a kept playing with zero underruns.
Worker-death recovery ships with it (worker_died event + restart button).

**Goal:** the actual DJ instrument.

Scope:

- Second deck worker; independent WebSocket per deck.
- Equal-power crossfader on the master bus.
- Per-deck model selection (`mrt2_small` / `mrt2_base`): switching restarts
  that worker only; UI warns when the combined choice looks tight for the
  machine's available RAM.
- Worker-death recovery: deck shows an error state and offers restart instead
  of taking the app down.

**Exit criteria:** start both decks on different prompts, blend between them
live; switch one deck's model while the other keeps playing.

## M4 — Performance features

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** Exit criteria verified end-to-end
(`frontend/scripts/verify_m4.mjs`). Shipped beyond the original two-slot
scope: each deck has a **2D style pad** with up to 8 prompt targets —
inverse-distance weighting blends the cursor position over all of them
(exact at a target, smooth everywhere else), applied at chunk boundaries
via cached-embedding averaging. Verified with a three-target glide on an
unbroken stream (zero underruns). Tempo proved emergent from style — text
hints are unreliable and injected clock conditioning is not read as a rate
([`spike-bpm.md`](spike-bpm.md), three rounds) — so **no tempo control
ships**; a bpm phrase typed into a style prompt is the honest interface.

**Goal:** smoother, more musical transitions.

Scope:

- Prompt morph within a deck: two prompt slots + morph slider, worker
  re-blends the style embedding per chunk.
- BPM control, best-effort: start with a tempo hint in the prompt; promote to
  per-deck nudge/sync only if steering proves reliable in practice.

**Exit criteria:** a deck can glide between two prompts without a hard style
jump; the UI only exposes the tempo control that actually works (no
overpromising).

## M5 — Recording and polish

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** Exit criteria verified end-to-end
(`frontend/scripts/verify_m5.mjs`): a 5-minute mix recorded off the master
bus to a valid stereo 48 kHz WAV (300.0 s, non-silent), and a reload
restoring pad arrangements, active style, volumes, and crossfade. Focus
shortcuts (A/B/X) ship with it. The verification also flushed out and
fixed a real reconnect race (a cancelled pump thread could eat the next
session's first event — `backend/scripts/repro_reconnect_echo.py`).

**Goal:** a jam is worth keeping; the app survives a session.

Scope:

- Session recording: tap the master bus, encode WAV client-side, download.
- Polish: keyboard shortcuts for fader/prompt focus, persisted last-used
  prompts/settings, graceful shutdown of workers.

**Exit criteria:** record a 5-minute mix to WAV that matches what was heard;
close/reopen the app and pick up previous settings.

## M6 — Deck EQ: Hi / Mid / Low

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** Exit criteria verified spectrally
(`frontend/scripts/verify_m6.mjs`): killing deck A's low band measured
**−39.6 dB** in the recorded master (Goertzel filter bank over the WAV)
with the high band untouched, deck B streaming cleanly with isolated
controls throughout, and the kill restored after reload. Known limit: the
mid band is a 1 kHz bell, so its bottom is a deep notch, not a full-band
kill (the shelf+peak trade-off of compact mixer EQs).

**Goal:** cut and boost frequency bands per deck like a DJ mixer — kill the
lows on the incoming deck, swap basslines across the crossfade.

Scope:

- Three BiquadFilterNodes per deck channel in the audio engine
  (ADR-0003's graph grows to: worklet → low shelf (~250 Hz) → mid peaking
  (~1 kHz) → high shelf (~2.5 kHz) → volume → crossfade). Pure, tested
  knob-value → dB curve: centre = flat (0 dB), top = +6 dB boost, bottom =
  full kill (−40 dB).
- Three per-deck EQ controls in the UI (design-system sliders), persisted
  like volume, restored on reload.
- Spectral verification, not vibes: the e2e records the master bus with
  LOW killed vs. flat on a playing deck and asserts the low-band energy
  drop in the WAV (the M5 harness already parses recordings).

**Exit criteria:** killing a band audibly (and measurably, in the recorded
spectrum) removes it while the other deck is unaffected; EQ settings
survive a reload.

## M7 — Hardware control: Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 over Web MIDI

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** All four scope items shipped (LED stretch
included): ControlBus, the unit-tested FLX4 translation table, Web MIDI
plumbing with the statusbar monitor, and intent wiring through the
existing UI handlers. Exit criteria verified on the physical device
against [`m7-hardware-checklist.md`](m7-hardware-checklist.md) — every
box ticked, including the hands-off mini-set; `verify_m7.mjs` smokes the
provider wiring and connect flow in CI-able form.

**Goal:** perform on physical hardware — the FLX4's surface drives the
decks, mixer, and style pads without touching the mouse. Architecture in
[ADR-0005](adr/0005-hardware-control-via-web-midi-in-the-frontend.md):
Web MIDI in the frontend, dispatching into the existing UI handlers.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **MIDI plumbing + monitor.** "Connect MIDI" button (user-gesture
   permission), device detection by name with a status indicator, and a
   debug monitor showing incoming messages. The byte map is already
   documented ([`midi-ddj-flx4.md`](midi-ddj-flx4.md), sourced from the
   Mixxx community mapping + Pioneer's official list); the monitor is the
   verification tool against the physical device's firmware.
2. **ControlBus.** Typed control intents (`{deck, action, value}`) as a
   small pub/sub: Deck and Mixer subscribe with their existing handlers,
   sources (MIDI now, anything later) publish. Keyboard/mouse unchanged.
3. **FLX4 mapping table** — pure and unit-tested, from
   [`midi-ddj-flx4.md`](midi-ddj-flx4.md):
   - channel faders → deck volumes; crossfader → master crossfade
     (14-bit MSB/LSB pairs)
   - PLAY/PAUSE per deck → play/stop
   - EQ HI/MID/LOW knobs → the M6 deck EQ bands (what a DJ expects)
   - performance pads 1–8 → snap the style-pad cursor to target N
     (cue points for prompts)
   - SMART CFX knob → sweep the style-pad cursor around the target
     circle (continuous morph; pads snap, the knob glides)
   - BEAT FX ON/OFF → record toggle
   - tempo sliders deliberately unmapped (ADR-0004); jog wheels unmapped
     in v1
4. **(Stretch) LED feedback** — light pads that have a style target, via
   MIDI out through the same module.

**Exit criteria:** with a DDJ-FLX4 connected, start/stop both decks, ride
the channel faders, EQs, and crossfader, jump styles from the pads and
morph with the CFX knob — hands off the mouse, with every hardware move
reflected live in the UI. Verified with the physical device against a written checklist
(hardware cannot be e2e-automated), plus unit tests for the full mapping
table.

## M8 — UI overhaul: from web page to instrument

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** Booth topology shipped — deck columns
flanking a centre mixer strip (EQ knob columns, LED channel meters,
vertical faders, crossfader, master/record) with live per-deck waveform
strips, tokens v2, and the full component kit (Knob, VerticalFader,
LevelMeter, TransportButton, Panel). All five e2e suites pass unchanged
in behaviour on the new surface; component CSS is token-only. Before /
after: [`docs/img/ui-before-m8.png`](img/ui-before-m8.png) →
[`docs/img/ui-after-m8.png`](img/ui-after-m8.png).

**Goal:** the app reads as DJ software — booth topology, hardware-style
controls, living signal displays — while behavior, hooks, and the audio
graph stay untouched (purely presentational; no ADR needed, ADR-0003's
architecture is unchanged). Aesthetic direction: rekordbox/Serato-class
dark instrument panels, no vendor trade dress.

Recommended execution order: **M6 (EQ function) → M8 (the face) → M7
(hardware)** — M8 ships the Knob component the EQ wants to live in, and
M7's LED/status work then lands on a stable surface. M8 has no hard
dependency either way.

Scope:

1. **Tokens v2.** Same token-only discipline, new vocabulary: near-black
   panel palette with inset borders (no floating-card shadows), per-deck
   accent colours (deck A ≠ deck B), LED state colours, condensed
   uppercase micro-labels, monospace numeric readouts, tighter spacing,
   small hardware radii. Light-touch motion (LED blink for REC, meter
   decay) — no decorative animation.
2. **Design-system components**, each specced before building (purpose /
   variants / states / API, per the design-system rule):
   - `Knob` — rotary with arc indicator; vertical-drag + arrow keys +
     double-click-to-centre; sizes S/M; used by EQ (M6) and morph sweep.
   - `VerticalFader` — channel volume; the crossfader stays horizontal.
   - `LevelMeter` — segmented LED column from an AnalyserNode, peak hold;
     per channel and master.
   - `TransportButton` — large square, lit state, icon glyphs.
   - `Panel` / `PanelLabel` — the structural chrome with silkscreen
     labels, replacing cards.
3. **Booth layout.** Full-viewport CSS grid, no page scroll:

   ```
   ┌────────────────────────┬──────────┬────────────────────────┐
   │ DECK A waveform strip  │  MASTER  │ DECK B waveform strip  │
   ├────────────────────────┤ meter ·  ├────────────────────────┤
   │ style pad   │ targets  │ REC ·    │ targets    │ style pad │
   │             │ model    │ status   │ model      │           │
   │ transport · readouts   ├──────────┤ transport · readouts   │
   │                        │ EQ knobs │                        │
   │                        │ ch faders│                        │
   │                        │ ─ xfade ─│                        │
   └────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────┘
   ```

   Connection/model/MIDI state moves into a thin status strip instead of
   prose inside cards.
4. **Per-deck waveform/spectrum strip** (pulled in from "Later"): an
   AnalyserNode tap per deck channel rendering a scrolling waveform or
   spectrum — the buffer-health meter stays, the strip makes the signal
   visible.
5. **Behaviour freeze.** Containers, hooks, reducers, engine, wire
   protocol: untouched. DeckPanel decomposes into presentational pieces;
   i18n keys and accessibility names survive so component tests and the
   e2e suites keep their selectors (updated only where labels genuinely
   change).

**Exit criteria:** the booth layout above at full viewport with the centre
mixer strip; every control rendered from the new design-system components
(no hardcoded colours/spacing outside tokens); live per-deck waveform
strips and channel meters; all existing e2e suites green on the new
surface; before/after screenshots in the PR.

## M9 — Split cue: pre-listen in headphones (PFL)

**Status: 🔶 built (2026-06-10), pending hardware verification.** Cue bus,
per-channel PFL taps, cue/master blend, device picker with the one-off
permission flow — all shipped and unit-tested; ADR-0006 records the
spike-settled routing. Exit criteria await a run of
[`m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md`](m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md).

**Goal:** audition a deck privately before the audience hears it — the
half of DJing the booth still lacks. With deck A on air, prime deck B,
listen to it in headphones, and only then fade it in.

Architecture
([ADR-0006](adr/0006-cue-output-via-a-second-audio-sink.md), settled by
spike): Chromium's Web Audio output is stereo per sink — after
`setSinkId(flx4)`, `maxChannelCount` reports 2, so the FLX4's 4-channel
USB path (phones on 3/4) is unreachable despite the hardware supporting
it (measured in `frontend/scripts/spike_cue_routing.mjs`). The cue feed
therefore goes out a **second sink**: master bus stays on
`context.destination`, cue bus → `MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode` → an
`<audio>` element `setSinkId`-routed to a user-chosen second device
(laptop jack, Bluetooth, built-ins). Intended FLX4 setup: system default
output = FLX4 (master RCA → speakers), headphones on the second device.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Output-routing spike.** Done — see ADR-0006 and the spike script;
   the single-context 4-channel path is rejected on measurement, the
   dual-sink path verified working. Includes the `enumerateDevices`
   permission flow needed to obtain device IDs (one-off mic grant).
2. **Cue bus in the engine.** Per-deck post-EQ, pre-fader tap → per-channel
   cue toggle gain → cue bus, plus a cue/master blend ("MIXING") gain pair
   for the headphone feed. Master bus, meters, and the recorder are
   untouched — the audience and the WAV never hear the cue.
3. **UI.** CUE toggle per channel strip (lit, LED-style), a cue-mix knob,
   and an output-device picker — all persisted like every other setting.

**Exit criteria:** with deck A on the master, toggling deck B's CUE makes
B audible in the headphones only; the mix knob blends cue↔master in the
phones; the audience feed never glitches while cueing; settings survive
a reload. Routing math unit-tested; the full flow verified on hardware
via an extended manual checklist (audio routing cannot be e2e-heard).

## M10 — Hardware cue: prep decks from the FLX4

**Status: 🔶 built (2026-06-10), pending hardware verification.** Channel
CUE buttons, the HEADPHONES MIX knob, and transport-CUE deck prep are
translated, wired, LED-echoed, and unit-tested; verification rides the
same checklist as M9.

**Goal:** the full pre-listen workflow with hands off the mouse,
completing the two-decks-and-headphones instrument.

Scope — bytes sourced from the Mixxx FLX4 mapping like M7's table, to be
verified with the in-app monitor:

1. **Channel CUE buttons** (`0x90`/`0x91` note `0x54`) → toggle each
   channel's headphone cue, with LED echo lighting the active cues.
2. **HEADPHONES MIX knob** (`0xB6` CC `0x0C`, LSB `0x2C` — it does send
   MIDI, unlike a typical analog monitor knob) → the M9 cue/master blend.
3. **Transport CUE buttons** (`0x90`/`0x91` note `0x0C`, the spare
   reserved since M7) → deck prep: CUE on a stopped deck starts
   generation silently (buffer filling, audible only over PFL), PLAY
   then drops it on air instantly; CUE while playing stops with flush.
   The generative analog of cueing a record.
4. New ControlBus intents + translator rows, unit-tested like the M7
   table; checklist addendum for the hardware run.

**Exit criteria:** hands off the mouse: prime deck B with CUE, audition
it via the channel-cue button and mix knob, drop it with PLAY, kill
deck A — cue LEDs mirroring state throughout. Unit tests cover every new
mapping row; verified on the physical device against the checklist.

## M11 — FLX4 phones jack: backend cue sink

**Status: 🔶 built (2026-06-10), pending hardware verification.** Backend
sink (sounddevice, drift-bounded FIFO, one-client socket), browser
capture + stream, and the picker integration shipped and unit-tested on
both sides; verification is the M11 section of
[`m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md`](m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md).

**Goal:** cue through the controller's own headphone jack — master on
the FLX4's RCA, phones on its jack, one USB cable, no Bluetooth.
Architecture in
[ADR-0007](adr/0007-flx4-phones-jack-via-a-backend-cue-sink.md): the
browser can't reach USB channels 3/4, but the backend can, and CoreAudio
mixes both clients on one device.

Scope:

1. **Backend sink.** `sounddevice` output stream on a ≥4-channel device:
   cue frames to channels 3/4, silence to 1/2; a drift-bounded FIFO
   between the WebSocket and the audio callback; `GET /api/cue/outputs`
   lists candidate devices; `/ws/cue` carries interleaved stereo float32
   up from the browser (the recorder worklet's native format).
2. **Frontend capture + stream.** A `pcm-recorder` instance taps the
   cue feed (post-blend); a small client owns the WebSocket lifecycle.
   The phones picker lists backend jacks alongside browser sinks and the
   choice persists like any other device.

**Exit criteria:** headphones in the FLX4's jack carry the cue while the
room hears only the RCA master; blend/PFL behaviour identical to the
browser-sink path; survives reload; pure parts (framing, FIFO, device
filtering) unit-tested; verified on hardware via the M9/M10 checklist's
M11 addendum.

## M12 — Color FX: one-knob effects per deck

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-10).** The canonical six shipped over pure
curves (ADR-0008) at the pre-fader insert, with the branch-pair bypass
making "off" bit-exact; UI selector + knob per deck, persisted; SMART
CFX remapped to the effect amount with the style sweep on SHIFT + knob.
Exit criteria verified on the physical device against
[`m12-hardware-checklist.md`](m12-hardware-checklist.md) — every box
ticked, including the monitor confirmations that shifted CFX keeps its
CC (the soft-shift assumption holds on this firmware) and that the
PAD FX bank sits at the interpolated `0x10` base, so pads 1–6 select
the effects with truthful LEDs.

**Goal:** sound-shape the running streams like a DJ mixer — per-deck
effects on the model of Pioneer's Sound Color FX: one knob per channel,
centre off, the turn shaping both wet amount and character. The SMART
CFX knob drives it from the hardware — the knob's actual purpose.
Deliberately Color FX and not Beat FX: the synced family (rolls,
beat-delays) needs a tempo grid we don't have (ADR-0004); one-knob
effects are tempo-free.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Effect insert + pure curves (ADR).** Per-deck insert point post-EQ,
   *before* the cue tap and fader, so the phones preview the effect on a
   primed deck exactly like a real mixer. Each effect is a pure
   `amount → parameters` curve (the EQ-math pattern, unit-tested) over a
   small node graph; selecting an effect swaps the graph, centre/zero is
   bit-transparent bypass. ADR records the insert point and the
   one-knob-curve convention.
2. **The canonical six** (DJM/rekordbox Sound Color FX vocabulary), in
   build order:
   - **Filter** — bipolar: left sweeps a low-pass, right a high-pass,
     centre flat (one BiquadFilter; the non-negotiable default)
   - **Dub Echo** — DelayNode + feedback gain + darkening filter in the
     loop; knob = feedback/wet
   - **Space** — ConvolverNode reverb with a generated impulse response;
     knob = wet blend
   - **Crush** — bit/sample-rate reduction in a small AudioWorklet;
     knob = intensity
   - **Noise** — filtered white-noise riser mixed in; knob sweeps its
     filter and level
   - **Sweep** — free-running LFO gate/duck (no tempo sync by design)
   - *(stretch)* **Flanger** and **Phaser** — LFO-modulated delay /
     all-pass chain
3. **UI.** Per-deck effect selector (the model-picker pattern) and an
   amount knob on the deck column; selection and amount persist like
   every other setting; active effect named in the deck status area.
4. **Hardware: the CFX handover.** SMART CFX remaps from style sweep to
   a new `fx_amount` intent (the knob's hardware meaning); the style
   sweep moves to **SHIFT + SMART CFX** if the firmware sends distinct
   bytes for the shifted knob — verify with the in-app monitor before
   relying on it — else the sweep stays on-screen-only (pads keep
   jumping styles regardless). Effect selection lives on the PAD FX
   pad bank: pads 1–6 pick the effect (LED-echoed, re-press for off).

**Exit criteria:** on a playing deck, every shipped effect audibly
transforms the stream and returns to bit-transparent at centre/zero;
the CFX knob rides the active effect with the on-screen knob following;
the cue feed previews effects on a primed deck; selection and amount
survive a reload; curves and the mapping rows unit-tested; verified on
the device against a checklist addendum.

## M13 — Freeze pads: capture and loop the moment

**Status: ✅ done (2026-06-11).** All four scope items shipped: ADR-0009
(capture from the player ring's played history — what was heard, not
what was queued — looped at the channel head behind a live/loop gain
pair), the unit-tested seam and capture-bookkeeping math, the four-slot
loop row with a persisted capture length, and the SAMPLER-bank mapping
with truthful LEDs. Exit criteria verified on the physical device
against [`m13-hardware-checklist.md`](m13-hardware-checklist.md) —
every box ticked, including the monitor confirmation that the SAMPLER
bank sits at the scheme's `0x30` base. Post-checklist hardware use
caught one firmware fact the spot-check missed: held SHIFT moves the
pads onto the shift pad layer (`0x98`/`0x9A`) instead of keeping their
status like the soft-shifted CFX knob, so the clear chord listens
there too.

**Goal:** a generative deck never plays the same thing twice — which is
the magic and the problem. When the model lands on something great,
freeze the last bars into a loop, keep it on air, and re-steer the model
underneath. The generative analog of a loop roll.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Capture + playback design (ADR).** Per-deck ring buffer of the most
   recent deck output, tapped raw (pre-EQ, the recorder-worklet pattern
   from M5/M11) so EQ, Color FX, fader, and cue stay live on the loop.
   Freeze swaps the channel source from the live stream to the captured
   loop; the worker keeps generating into the now-silent stream so
   unfreezing returns to fresh material — M10's deck prep already models
   an inaudible running deck. The ADR records the tap point, the loop
   scheduling (boundary crossfade against clicks), and what the live
   stream does while frozen.
2. **Loop engine.** Capture ring in a worklet; loop playback with a short
   boundary crossfade; loop length adjustable in seconds (quantised to
   whole beats once M14 lands). Scheduling math pure and unit-tested.
3. **UI.** Freeze control and loop length per deck; the waveform strip
   shows frozen state. Loops are session-only — captured audio is
   deliberately not persisted.
4. **Hardware.** Loop slots on a spare FLX4 pad bank — the 0x10-per-bank
   scheme puts SAMPLER at a predictable base, but confirm with the
   in-app monitor before mapping, exactly as PAD FX was in M12. Empty
   pad captures, lit pad plays, re-press returns to live; LEDs truthful
   throughout.

**Exit criteria:** while a deck plays, freezing loops the last bars
seamlessly on air with EQ and Color FX still live; unfreezing returns to
the live stream without a glitch or underrun; the style pad can re-steer
the model while frozen and the new material is there on release; pads
capture and trigger from the FLX4 with truthful LEDs; capture and
scheduling math unit-tested; verified on the device against a checklist
addendum.

## M14 — Beat detection: a tempo estimate from the output

**Status: ⬜ planned.**

**Goal:** ADR-0004 stands — tempo is not a *generation* parameter — but
detecting tempo on the generated stream is a different question. A
confident BPM estimate unlocks the beat-aware features the booth forgoes
today: tempo-synced Dub Echo, beat-trimmed M13 loops, and an honest BPM
readout per deck.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Spike: is generative output beat-trackable?** Onset detection plus
   autocorrelation over recorded WAVs across styles (four-on-the-floor
   techno through ambient), building on [`spike-bpm.md`](spike-bpm.md).
   The deliverable is a measured confidence gate: when the estimator is
   unsure it must show nothing, never a wrong number. Kill criterion: if
   no style family yields a stable estimate, the milestone parks here —
   the spike is the risk, like M9's routing spike.
2. **Live estimator.** Per-deck onset/tempo tracker producing
   `{bpm, confidence, phase}`; the deck status shows BPM only above the
   gate.
3. **Consumers.** Dub Echo gains a synced mode (delay snaps to a beat
   fraction) at high confidence and stays free-running otherwise; M13
   loop lengths quantise to whole beats when available; *(stretch)* a
   beat-pulsing LED on a spare button.

**Exit criteria:** on a steady rhythmic stream the estimate holds within
±2% of a hand-counted reference for a minute; on beatless material the
readout honestly shows nothing; synced Dub Echo audibly locks to the
groove; estimator math unit-tested against synthetic click tracks and
recorded fixtures.

## M15 — Deck-to-deck style transfer: "sound like deck A"

**Status: ⬜ planned.**

**Goal:** MRT styles can come from reference audio, not just text — and
the most useful reference in a booth is the *other deck*. One action puts
"the sound of deck A, right now" on deck B's style pad as a blendable
target: a harmonic-mixing substitute for a world with no key or tempo
grid.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Spike: style-from-audio quality (ADR).** Embed ~10 s of generated
   output through MRT's audio-style path and apply it to the other deck;
   judge resemblance by ear and measure embedding latency — it must not
   stall either generating stream (the same isolation rule as everything
   in `engine.py`). The ADR records capture length, where the embedding
   runs, and the caching model (audio embeddings cache like text-prompt
   embeddings).
2. **Capture → worker path.** The recorder-worklet + WebSocket pattern
   from M11 ships the last N seconds of a deck upstream; the worker
   embeds once and caches.
3. **UI + pad integration.** The captured style lands on the style pad
   as a target like any text prompt (labelled as sampled from the other
   deck): weight-blendable, re-sampleable, removable. Persistence is an
   ADR decision — embeddings don't survive a worker restart, so the
   honest options are session-only or persisting the captured clip.
4. ***(Stretch)* file-drop styles** — drop an audio file on the pad as a
   style target; subsumes the previously parked "audio-prompt styles"
   idea.

**Exit criteria:** with deck A playing, one action adds an "A, sampled
now" target to deck B's pad; at full weight B audibly shifts toward A's
character; the target blends with text targets by weight like any other;
neither stream glitches during capture or embedding; the spike's
resemblance and latency findings are recorded in the ADR.

## M16 — Crates: a library of saved styles

**Status: ⬜ planned.**

**Goal:** a set shouldn't be retyped. Save a deck's pad arrangement as a
named preset, organise presets into crates, and load them mid-set — from
the FLX4's browse controls, no laptop needed.

Scope:

1. **Preset model + storage.** Name + pad targets and weights (+ the
   deck's Color FX selection), stored like the rest of persistence
   (`persistence.ts`); JSON export/import for backup and sharing.
2. **UI.** Save-as-preset on the deck, a crate browser, load-to-deck;
   loading re-embeds prompts exactly like typing them (cached embeddings
   make repeats cheap).
3. **Hardware.** The FLX4 browse rotary (turn = highlight, press/LOAD =
   load to deck) — bytes from the Mixxx map, verified with the in-app
   monitor before wiring, mapping rows unit-tested like every table
   since M7.

**Exit criteria:** save a preset, reload the app, browse crates from the
rotary, and load onto deck B while deck A keeps playing uninterrupted;
export/import round-trips; mapping rows unit-tested; verified on the
device against a checklist addendum.

## M17 — Master housekeeping: limiter and gain match

**Status: ⬜ planned.**

**Goal:** every real mixer protects its output. Stacked EQ boosts plus
Color FX can push the master past full scale, and decks differ in
inherent loudness; both problems are silent until they ruin a recording.

Scope:

1. **Master limiter.** A limiter ahead of both `context.destination` and
   the recorder tap (the WAV captures what was heard). Start with a
   DynamicsCompressorNode configured as a limiter; reach for a lookahead
   worklet only if measurement shows pumping. The master meter shows
   gain reduction.
2. **Per-deck auto-gain.** A slow loudness tracker per deck feeding a
   trim gain so decks land at comparable level through matched faders;
   manual trim override; channel meters read post-trim.
3. **Measured verification, not vibes** (the M6 pattern): an e2e records
   the master under deliberately hot settings (full EQ boost + Crush)
   and asserts the WAV's peak stays under the ceiling; gain match is
   asserted as an RMS delta between two decks of different loudness.

**Exit criteria:** the recorded master never exceeds the ceiling under a
deliberately hot mix; two decks of clearly different loudness land
within ~1 dB through matched faders; trims and levels persist; verified
by level measurement in e2e like M6.

## Later (not committed)

Ideas parked deliberately — each would get its own ADR if picked up:

- **Tauri desktop wrap** — webview + Python sidecars; revisit trigger in
  ADR-0002.
- **C++ engine (`magentart::core`) backend** — single distributable binary,
  supersedes ADR-0002 if pursued.
- **Controller LED/display feedback beyond M7's stretch and M10's cue
  LEDs** — full bidirectional surface state (requires the FLX4 output
  map).
- **Style motion** — automate the style-pad cursor (LFO between targets,
  or record a pad gesture and loop it) so a deck evolves hands-free.

## Standing risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| Machine falls short of two real-time instances | Glitchy decks | Run on Pro/Max-class hardware; `mrt2_small` as default; buffer-health UI (M2) makes shortfall visible |
| BPM not reliably steerable by prompt | M4 scope shrinks | Treated as best-effort from the start; UI follows what works |
| MRT2 streaming API shifts under us (young project) | Rework in workers | Worker isolates all `magenta_rt` calls behind one small interface |
| Memory pressure with `mrt2_base` decks | Crashes mid-session | RAM guardrails in model picker (M3); worker-death recovery |
| FLX4 MIDI map differs from docs / firmware | Dead or wrong controls | Map sourced from the proven Mixxx mapping (docs/midi-ddj-flx4.md); in-app monitor verifies against the device |
| Web MIDI is Chromium-only | No hardware control elsewhere | Accepted (ADR-0005); on-screen UI unaffected |
