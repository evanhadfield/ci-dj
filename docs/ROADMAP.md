# magenta-dj Roadmap

A DJ interface over [Magenta RealTime 2](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime):
two locally-running model "decks" steered by text prompts, blended with a
crossfader — grown by M19 into a hybrid booth where a deck can also play a
composed track. Architecture decisions are recorded in [`adr/`](adr/) —
notably [ADR-0002](adr/0002-browser-app-with-python-model-workers.md)
(browser app, Python model workers) and
[ADR-0003](adr/0003-frontend-audio-mixing-via-web-audio.md) (frontend
mixing via Web Audio).

Milestones are ordered by risk: each one retires the biggest remaining
unknown before building on top of it. No dates — exit criteria gate
progression. Done milestones below are deliberately terse; the full
scope, exit criteria, and measured records live in this file's git
history and the linked ADRs/checklists.

Standing assumption: Apple Silicon with headroom for two concurrent
model instances (Pro/Max-class for two `mrt2_base` decks); buffer-health
surfacing (M2) is how a machine that falls short shows it.

## Done

### M1 — One deck, audible ✅ (2026-06-09)

Worker → WebSocket → browser playback skeleton; protocol v0 (binary PCM
+ JSON control). MRT2 API facts measured into
[`spike-mrt2.md`](spike-mrt2.md); verified by `verify_m1.py`.

### M2 — Real frontend ✅ (2026-06-09)

React app replaces the test page; per-deck health row (buffer meter,
underrun counter, generation speed) makes generation-too-slow honest.
Verified by `verify_m2.mjs`.

### M3 — Two decks, crossfader, model picker ✅ (2026-06-09)

Independent deck workers, equal-power crossfade, per-deck
`mrt2_small`/`mrt2_base` picker with a RAM warning, worker-death
recovery (error state + restart). Verified by `verify_m3.mjs`.

### M4 — Performance features ✅ (2026-06-10)

The 2D style pad: up to 8 prompt targets, inverse-distance blending
applied at chunk boundaries via cached embeddings. Tempo proved emergent
from style — not steerable by hint or clock conditioning
([`spike-bpm.md`](spike-bpm.md)) — so no tempo control ships
([ADR-0004](adr/0004-style-is-a-weighted-prompt-blend-tempo-is-not-a-parameter.md)).
Verified by `verify_m4.mjs`.

### M5 — Recording and polish ✅ (2026-06-10)

Master-bus recording to WAV, persisted settings, focus shortcuts; fixed
a real reconnect race (`backend/scripts/repro_reconnect_echo.py`).
Verified by `verify_m5.mjs`.

### M6 — Deck EQ: Hi / Mid / Low ✅ (2026-06-10)

Three-band EQ per deck with kill (low-kill measured **−39.6 dB** in the
recorded master); known limit: the mid is a 1 kHz bell, so its bottom is
a deep notch, not a full-band kill. Verified spectrally by
`verify_m6.mjs`.

### M7 — Hardware control: DDJ-FLX4 over Web MIDI ✅ (2026-06-10)

[ADR-0005](adr/0005-hardware-control-via-web-midi-in-the-frontend.md):
ControlBus intents, the unit-tested FLX4 translation table from
[`midi-ddj-flx4.md`](midi-ddj-flx4.md), the statusbar monitor as the
firmware arbiter, pad LED echo. Verified on the device against
[`m7-hardware-checklist.md`](m7-hardware-checklist.md).

### M8 — UI overhaul: from web page to instrument ✅ (2026-06-10)

Booth topology (deck columns flanking the mixer strip), tokens v2, the
component kit (Knob, VerticalFader, LevelMeter, TransportButton, Panel),
live waveform strips. Purely presentational; before/after in
[`img/`](img/).

### M9 — Split cue: pre-listen in headphones 🔶 built (2026-06-10)

Cue bus with per-channel PFL taps and a cue/master blend out a **second
sink** ([ADR-0006](adr/0006-cue-output-via-a-second-audio-sink.md) —
Chromium caps Web Audio at stereo per sink, measured). Pending a formal
run of [`m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md`](m9-m10-hardware-checklist.md).

### M10 — Hardware cue from the FLX4 🔶 built (2026-06-10)

Channel CUE buttons, HEADPHONES MIX knob, and transport-CUE deck prep
(generate off air, drop with PLAY), LED-echoed; same checklist as M9.

### M11 — FLX4 phones jack: backend cue sink 🔶 built (2026-06-10)

The browser can't reach USB channels 3/4; the backend can
([ADR-0007](adr/0007-flx4-phones-jack-via-a-backend-cue-sink.md)):
sounddevice sink, drift-bounded FIFO, `/ws/cue` carrying the cue feed
up. Same checklist, M11 addendum.

### M12 — Color FX: one-knob effects per deck ✅ (2026-06-10)

The canonical six (Filter, Dub Echo, Space, Crush, Noise, Sweep) as pure
amount→parameter curves at a pre-fader insert with bit-exact bypass
([ADR-0008](adr/0008-color-fx-as-one-knob-curves-at-a-pre-fader-insert.md));
SMART CFX drives the amount, style sweep on SHIFT, PAD FX bank selects.
Verified against [`m12-hardware-checklist.md`](m12-hardware-checklist.md).

### M13 — Freeze pads: capture and loop the moment ✅ (2026-06-11)

Capture the player ring's played history into four loop slots, looped at
the channel head behind a live/loop gain pair
([ADR-0009](adr/0009-freeze-pads-loop-played-audio-at-the-channel-head.md));
SAMPLER bank with truthful LEDs. Firmware fact: held SHIFT moves pads to
the shift pad layer (`0x98`/`0x9A`). Verified against
[`m13-hardware-checklist.md`](m13-hardware-checklist.md).

### M14 — Beat detection behind an honesty gate ✅ (2026-06-11)

Frontend onset/tempo estimator on the wire feed
([ADR-0010](adr/0010-beat-detection-on-the-output-behind-an-honesty-gate.md),
[`spike-beat-detection.md`](spike-beat-detection.md)): shows a BPM only
after stable confident agreement, never a wrong number. Consumers:
synced Dub Echo, beat-quantised loop captures. Phase deliberately
dropped (no consumer needed it — until M20). Verified against
[`m14-hardware-checklist.md`](m14-hardware-checklist.md).

### M15 — Deck-to-deck style transfer ✅ (2026-06-11)

"Sound like deck A": ~10 s of the other deck's played audio embedded as
a blendable pad target
([ADR-0011](adr/0011-deck-to-deck-style-sampling-via-audio-embeddings.md));
sampled targets are deliberately mortal (session-only, die with their
worker). Verified against
[`m15-hardware-checklist.md`](m15-hardware-checklist.md).

### M16 — Crates: a library of saved styles ✅ (2026-06-11)

Named presets (text targets + cursor + Color FX) with versioned JSON
export/import; browse + load from the FLX4 rotary and LOAD buttons.
Verified against [`m16-hardware-checklist.md`](m16-hardware-checklist.md).

### M17 — Master housekeeping: limiter and gain match ✅ (2026-06-11)

Compressor-as-limiter (implicit makeup gain measured and cancelled) plus
a hard clip guard at a binary-exact ceiling; per-channel auto-trim
toward a loudness target. Measured: a deliberately hot mix peaked 0.708
under the 0.9297 ceiling; two unlike decks landed **0.52 dB** apart on
AUTO. Verified by measurement in `verify_m17.mjs`.

### M18 — Generated pads: text-to-audio into the loop slots ✅ (2026-06-12)

Stable Audio 3 small models via a spawned `sa3_mlx` subprocess
([ADR-0012](adr/0012-generated-pads-via-a-spawned-sa3-mlx-subprocess.md))
plus Magenta as a dedicated third render engine. Measured: ~1–1.5 s
whole-process wall per clip, ≤1.5 GB transient; sm-music loops floored
at 7 s (breaks up under ~4 s). Verified by `verify_m18.mjs` +
[`m18-checklist.md`](m18-checklist.md).

### M19 — Track deck: trade the stream for a composed track ✅ (2026-06-12)

[ADR-0013](adr/0013-playback-decks-play-decoded-tracks-loading-decides-the-mode.md):
a deck's mode is realtime or playback, and **loading decides it** — the
Media Explorer below the booth owns all loading (crates folded in,
Generate with all four models, a session-only folder browser, the live
stream itself loadable). Playback is a buffer source through the live
gain: transport, overview + jog seeking, offline BPM at load, a rolling
deck keeps rolling across mode switches. Measured: SA3 medium composes
2:00 in **14.9 s wall at 4.9 GB peak**; all weights moved into
`just setup`. Verified by `verify_m19.mjs` +
[`m19-hardware-checklist.md`](m19-hardware-checklist.md).

## M20 — Beatgrids and sync: the track follows the booth

**Status: 🔶 built (2026-06-12), pending hardware verification.** All
four scope items shipped on ADR-0014: the offline grid pass (period
refined by fold-resultant search, drift refused by half-split
agreement — a 120→126 splice yields no grid), varispeed with the
tempo sliders mapped at last, SYNC from gated BPMs alone (the grid
cannot take tempo-matching down with it), the dual-role jog
(paused = seek, playing = stepped-bend phase nudge), grid ticks on
the overview, and a phase meter comparing the track's grid clock
against the live deck's beat **at the speakers** — the worklet now
reports consumed frames in its own clock, because the wire feed
leads the room by the buffer. Hardened against real material: both
folds ride the LOW band's linear energy rise (full-band and even
log-domain folds cancel against offbeat hats), the grid floor is
calibrated on real renders (rolling techno folds at 0.50–0.65;
each half owes its own coherence so a spliced tempo still refuses),
and a single breathing estimate rides out on the gate's grace.
Measured live (`verify_m20.mjs`): SYNC landed the gated stream BPM
to the decimal, and a track-to-track lock held a full minute at
**0.000 beats/min drift**. The audible half awaits
[`m20-hardware-checklist.md`](m20-hardware-checklist.md).

**Goal:** real beat-matching. A playback deck holds its entire decoded
buffer, so a proper **beatgrid** — BPM *and* beat phase — is computable
offline at load, far more accurately than any live estimate; and
`AudioBufferSourceNode.playbackRate` gives varispeed for free. The live
stream cannot change tempo (ADR-0004 stands for generation), so sync is
one-directional by design: **the track follows the booth** — match the
track's rate to the other deck's gated BPM, then ride the phase.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Beatgrid analysis (ADR).** Extend the M14 estimator family with an
   offline grid pass: BPM plus first-beat phase over the decoded buffer,
   constant-tempo assumption recorded (generated tracks are steady;
   folder tracks may drift — measure on a corpus). Same honesty rule as
   M14: no confident grid, no grid shown. Kill criterion: if phase
   proves unstable on the corpus, grid display and quantise park here —
   varispeed and manual beat-matching still ship.
2. **Varispeed.** A tempo slider per playback deck (±8% default range)
   driving `playbackRate`; pitch shifts with rate — the classic
   varispeed trade-off, recorded; time-stretch is a Later idea. The FLX4
   **tempo sliders** map at last (M7 left them deliberately unmapped;
   the ADR records why that reversal doesn't touch ADR-0004 — playback
   rate is not generation tempo). Position math in `audio/track.ts`
   grows a rate term, still pure.
3. **SYNC and phase.** A SYNC control matches the track's BPM to the
   other deck's gated BPM (refusing honestly when the gate is blank); a
   phase meter shows the beat offset between decks; the jog becomes
   mode-aware like a real deck — **playing = phase nudge, paused = seek**
   (today's behaviour).
4. **Grid display.** Beat ticks on the TrackOverview, downbeats heavier,
   only while the grid is confident.

**Exit criteria:** load a steady track against a streaming deck, press
SYNC, and the beats lock audibly for a minute with the phase meter
agreeing; the jog corrects drift while playing; the tempo slider rides
the rate smoothly from screen and hardware; grid math unit-tested
against click tracks and drifting fixtures; verified on the device
against a checklist.

## M21 — Hot cues and track loops

**Status: ⬜ planned.**

**Goal:** on a playback deck, pads mean *position*. The HOT CUE bank —
style-target snaps on a realtime deck — becomes what its label says, and
the track gains beat-quantised loops.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Hot cues.** HOT CUE pads on a playback deck: an empty pad sets a
   cue at the playhead, a filled pad jumps to it, SHIFT+pad clears —
   LEDs truthful, markers drawn on the overview. Quantised to the M20
   grid when confident, free when not (the M14 consumer rule).
   Session-only like every captured artefact.
2. **In/out loops.** A beat-quantised loop on the track via the buffer
   source's native `loopStart`/`loopEnd`; in/out/exit controls on screen
   and on the FLX4 **LOOP section** (unmapped since M7 — bytes from the
   Mixxx chart, monitor-verified like every bank).
3. **UI.** Cue markers and the loop region shaded on the TrackOverview.

**Exit criteria:** set and jump cues from the pads with truthful LEDs
while the track plays; a 4-beat loop locks seamlessly on the grid and
releases cleanly; quantise degrades honestly without a grid; new intents
and mapping rows unit-tested; verified on the device against a
checklist.

## M22 — Dual zoomed waveforms: visual beatmatching

**Status: 🔶 built (2026-06-12), pending eye verification.** Pulled
forward into the M20 verification workflow — judging an audible lock
with only a needle proved too hard on the device. Shipped: hop-indexed
band envelopes for both decks (offline at track load; a rolling
60-second scroller on the live wire, verified identical to the offline
pass on the same audio), the ZoomStrip drawing them as colour at 60 Hz
with beat marks from each deck's M20 clock, the stacked BeatView, and
the persisted three-way layout switcher. Verified by eye alongside the
M20 checklist.

**Goal:** the visual half of beat-matching — stacked, beat-aligned,
scrolling **band-coloured** close-up waveforms for both decks
(lows/mids/highs as colour, amplitude as height — the rekordbox
convention; a true spectrogram is a later renderer mode), with beat
marks from each deck's M20 clock. The honest catch: today's per-deck
strip is decorative (a post-fader analyser window); this milestone
makes the close-up sample-accurate. M20 already built the hard
prerequisites: the worklet reports played frames in the audio clock,
and both decks carry beat clocks to draw marks from.

Scope, ordered by risk:

1. **Sample-accurate sources.** Track deck: slice the decoded buffer
   around the playhead (cheap, exact; band envelopes computed offline
   at load). Live deck: a real feed from the pushed PCM (the beat
   tracker's tap), aligned to the played position via the worklet's
   consumed-frames clock (M20) — incremental band envelopes as chunks
   arrive.
2. **The stacked view.** Both decks' zoom strips stacked in the centre,
   playheads fixed mid-screen, beat marks overlaid where each clock is
   confident (heavier downbeats); canvas-rendered, no per-frame React.
3. **Layout switcher, persisted.** Three options: centre stacked
   (between the deck columns — the beatmatch view), full-width bar
   above the booth, and compact/off (today's per-deck strips stay the
   minimal mode).
4. **Alignment truth.** When M20 says the decks are in sync, the marks
   visually coincide — the view must not lie about phase.

**Exit criteria:** both strips scroll in lockstep with what is heard
(no perceptible lag against transients); a synced pair shows coinciding
beat marks; the band colouring visibly separates kicks from hats; all
three layouts switch live and the choice survives a reload; 60 Hz with
both decks running and zero added underruns; verified by eye against a
checklist on the device.

## Later (not committed)

Ideas parked deliberately — each would get its own ADR if picked up:

- **Key detection + camelot matching** — offline per-track key analysis,
  compatibility hints in the Media Explorer.
- **Per-track auto-gain at load** — M17's trim holds in playback mode
  today; a decoded buffer's loudness is knowable up front.
- **Quantised triggers** — pads, FX, and mode switches snapped to the
  M20 grid.
- **Persistent track library** — cached analysis (grid/key/gain) and
  folder handles need an IndexedDB layer; today everything is
  deliberately session-only.
- **Track-buffer slicing** — captures and style sampling from a playback
  deck (the ADR-0013 deferral; ring history can't serve them).
- **Time-stretch** — tempo without pitch (a worklet); varispeed's
  upgrade path.
- **Tauri desktop wrap** — webview + Python sidecars; revisit trigger in
  ADR-0002.
- **C++ engine (`magentart::core`) backend** — single distributable
  binary, supersedes ADR-0002 if pursued.
- **Full controller LED/display feedback** — bidirectional surface state
  beyond the shipped pad/cue echoes (needs the FLX4 output map).
- **Style motion** — automate the style-pad cursor (LFO between targets,
  or record and loop a pad gesture).

## Standing risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| Machine falls short of two real-time instances | Glitchy decks | Run on Pro/Max-class hardware; `mrt2_small` as default; buffer-health UI (M2) makes shortfall visible |
| MRT2 streaming API shifts under us (young project) | Rework in workers | Worker isolates all `magenta_rt` calls behind one small interface |
| Memory pressure with `mrt2_base` decks | Crashes mid-session | RAM guardrails in model picker (M3); worker-death recovery |
| FLX4 MIDI map differs from docs / firmware | Dead or wrong controls | Map sourced from the proven Mixxx mapping (docs/midi-ddj-flx4.md); in-app monitor verifies against the device |
| Web MIDI is Chromium-only | No hardware control elsewhere | Accepted (ADR-0005); on-screen UI unaffected |
| `sa3_mlx` is a checkout + CLI, not a pinned package | Upstream drift breaks generation | Checkout pinned to a commit; one backend module owns the spawn contract; a missing or failing CLI degrades to a clear error with the decks unaffected |
| Beat phase on generated/folder tracks may be unstable (M20) | Sync lands off-beat | Offline analysis behind the M14 honesty rule; kill criterion parks grid features while varispeed still ships |
| Varispeed shifts pitch with rate (M20) | Extreme rates sound wrong | ±8% default range (the classic DJ envelope); time-stretch recorded as the Later upgrade |
