//! The engine host: a dedicated render thread that owns the [`Engine`], plus a
//! thread-safe control surface the rest of the process (the Tauri IPC thread)
//! drives (Phase 2, step 2).
//!
//! # Why a decoupled render thread (the load-bearing design)
//!
//! [`Engine`] has `&mut self` methods for BOTH the RT path ([`Engine::render`],
//! alloc-free) and control ([`Engine::set_eq`], [`Engine::load_track`], … — some
//! of which ALLOCATE, rebuilding `fundsp` nodes or taking ownership of a decoded
//! buffer). A single thread must own the `Engine` (Rust's `&mut self` rules make
//! that ownership the whole RT-safety argument: a control mutation and a render
//! can never overlap). If the cpal device callback owned the `Engine`, applying a
//! control command would allocate INSIDE the audio callback — forbidden.
//!
//! So the `Engine` lives on its own spawned **render thread**, NOT in the cpal
//! callback. That thread loops:
//!
//! 1. Drain the wait-free [`Command`] channel, applying each command to the
//!    `Engine`. Allocs are FINE here — this is not the cpal callback. The old
//!    buffers/nodes a command replaces are dropped HERE too, off the callback.
//! 2. Render blocks via [`Engine::render`] into the **output ring** (an `rtrb`
//!    of interleaved-stereo f32), pacing to keep it filled to a target depth
//!    ([`OUTPUT_RING_TARGET_FRAMES`]) and parking briefly when it is full.
//! 3. Publish a [`Snapshot`] (per-deck track status / loop slots) behind a
//!    `Mutex` the IPC thread reads.
//!
//! The cpal device callback ([`crate::device::run_host_stream`]) ONLY drains the
//! output ring into the device buffer, counts an underrun if the ring is short,
//! and sets FTZ/DAZ — trivially alloc-free, still under `assert_no_alloc`.
//!
//! ## The latency trade-off (a deliberate v1 choice)
//!
//! Going through the output ring adds the ring's depth
//! (~[`OUTPUT_RING_TARGET_FRAMES`] frames, tens of ms) of latency on top of the
//! device buffer, versus rendering directly in the callback. We accept that here
//! because rendering in the callback is incompatible with allocating control
//! commands. The lower-latency build-and-swap-in-callback design (render in the
//! callback; deliver control as pre-built nodes over a wait-free channel and
//! return the old ones over a garbage channel) is a future optimisation — it
//! needs settable-coefficient EQ (or handed-across chains) and that garbage-return
//! path, neither of which exists yet. This decoupled design keeps every alloc off
//! the callback today with no engine reshaping.
