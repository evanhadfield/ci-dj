//! The playback buffer source (Phase 1, Slice 4a) — a deck playing a decoded
//! track instead of the live Magenta stream (M19 playback, M20 varispeed,
//! M21/M23 track loops, peaks; ADR-0013/0014/0015/0016).
//!
//! This is the native home of the Web Audio playback path
//! (`frontend/src/audio/engine.ts` `DeckChannel` track methods +
//! `frontend/src/audio/track.ts` pure transport math). The browser had to anchor
//! offsets against context time because an `AudioBufferSourceNode` can neither
//! pause nor report a playhead; here the playhead IS the state, advanced directly
//! by the RT [`BufferSource::pop_frame`] each output sample.
//!
//! # The mode handoff (ADR-0013)
//!
//! Loading decides the mode: [`DeckSource::Realtime`] (the per-deck
//! [`RingConsumer`], Slices 1–3) or [`DeckSource::Playback`] (a [`BufferSource`]).
//! `load_track` switches a deck to `Playback` and **parks** the live ring (kept,
//! not destroyed) so `unload_track` can restore it. `render`/`mix_frame` pulls
//! each deck's stereo frame from whichever source is active; the rest of the
//! channel (EQ/FX/volume/crossfade/limiter) is unchanged.
//!
//! # Varispeed = plain resampling (ADR-0014)
//!
//! Per output sample the fractional playhead advances by the rate; the output is
//! **linear-interpolated** between the two buffer samples bracketing it — exactly
//! `AudioBufferSourceNode.playbackRate`, so pitch shifts with rate. At rate 1.0
//! the playhead lands on integers and the buffer is read verbatim.
//!
//! # Loops (ADR-0015/0016)
//!
//! The loop region lives on the source in frames; the playhead **folds** through
//! `[start, end)` (a pure [`fold_into_loop`]). **Any seek exits the loop** — the
//! one rule, no dormant regions. The two moments the playhead can sit outside the
//! region on a *set* get a deterministic [`plan_loop_set`] decision (restart /
//! reanchor / park / apply / refuse) rather than relying on the wrap-on-reach
//! edge.
