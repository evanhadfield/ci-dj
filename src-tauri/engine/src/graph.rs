//! The bare mix, ported from the Spike A `rt_engine` callback
//! (`spike/rust-audio/engine/src/bin/rt_engine.rs`): per-deck 3-band EQ, a
//! per-deck volume fader, an equal-power crossfade, and the master limiter
//! (feed-forward compressor → makeup cancellation → clip-guard ceiling).
//!
//! Built OFF the RT thread (the `fundsp` nodes allocate at construction). On the
//! RT path only `tick` / arithmetic run — both alloc-free on a pre-built node.
//!
//! ## Parity discipline (Spike A, `docs/spike-rust-audio.md`)
//!
//! The exact Chromium-vs-fundsp waveform parity was already proven offline in
//! Spike A against an `OfflineAudioContext` golden (`spike/rust-audio/golden/`):
//! the EQ shelves/bell match to ~1e-6, the limiter holds the two invariants
//! (ceiling exact, sub-threshold transparency). The headless CI tests in this
//! crate verify the *curve* (EQ kill/flat/boost levels) and the limiter
//! *invariants*, not a waveform diff — the diff was the spike's job, not CI's.
