//! SlipMate native shell — the Tauri v2 app host (Phase 2).
//!
//! This embeds the React frontend, wires the WebMIDI plugin, starts the Rust
//! audio engine, and exposes the engine control surface to the webview over IPC.
//!
//! # The audio host lifecycle (the load-bearing bit)
//!
//! On `setup` we build a [`Host`] ([`slipmate_engine::host`]). `Host::new` builds
//! the [`Engine`], creates its two decks, and KEEPS the engine on a dedicated
//! **render thread** — control commands and the RT render both need `&mut Engine`,
//! and some control ops allocate (rebuilding `fundsp` nodes, taking a decoded
//! buffer), so they must NOT run in the cpal callback. The render thread owns the
//! engine, drains a wait-free command channel, and renders into an output ring;
//! the cpal callback only drains that ring (ADR-style decoupling — see the `host`
//! module docs and its latency note).
//!
//! `Host::new` also returns the two [`DeckHandle`]s — the non-RT producer side of
//! each deck's input ring. They are the sidecar PCM feed's writers; a later step
//! moves them onto the sidecar transport thread. Until then they are held in
//! managed state so they stay alive (dropping a producer would close its ring).
//!
//! We then start the cpal device via [`engine_device::run_host_stream`], which
//! drains the host's output ring in its callback. In a sandbox / headless CI
//! there is often no exact-48000/f32 device; that path returns
//! [`DeviceError::Unavailable`] and we continue with no stream — the host's render
//! thread keeps filling the ring (nothing drains it, which is fine), so control
//! and read-back still work and the window still opens.
//!
//! The [`Host`] is held in Tauri **managed state** so every `#[tauri::command]`
//! can drive it; managed state lives for the app's lifetime, so the render thread
//! (and the device stream) run until shutdown.
