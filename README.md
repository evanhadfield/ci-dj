# magenta-dj

A DJ rig over [Magenta RealTime 2](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime):
two locally-running model decks steered by text prompts, mixed with
three-band EQ, one-knob Color FX, and a crossfader, pre-listened in
headphones, and playable from a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4. See
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for how it got here and
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) for the architecture decisions.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (MLX backend)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- ~2 GB disk for model weights (downloaded on first setup)
- A Chromium-based browser (the app leans on Web Audio worklets and Web MIDI;
  it is developed and verified against Chrome)
- Optional: a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 for hardware control and its headphone jack

All common tasks live in the [`justfile`](justfile) — run `just` to list them.

## Setup

```sh
just setup   # backend deps, model weights (~1.8 GB), frontend deps + build
```

Models land in `~/Documents/Magenta/magenta-rt-v2` (override with
`MAGENTA_HOME`). `just download-base-model` additionally fetches `mrt2_base`,
selectable per deck in the UI — heavier and higher-quality; the app warns
when the combined selection looks tight for your RAM.

## Run

```sh
just run
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> — add style targets to a deck's pad, hit
play, blend targets by dragging the cursor (or the dots themselves, to
cluster them), and ride the crossfader between decks.

- **Mixer** — per-deck volume and Hi/Mid/Low EQ, crossfader, and **Record**,
  which captures the master bus to a downloadable WAV. The health row shows
  the stream buffer, underrun count, and generation speed.
- **Color FX** — one knob per deck over a chosen effect: Filter (bipolar
  LPF/HPF), Dub Echo, Space, Crush, Noise, Sweep. The knob's centre/zero is a
  bit-exact bypass ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-color-fx-as-one-knob-curves-at-a-pre-fader-insert.md)).
- **Headphone cue** — hit a channel's **Cue**, ride the **Cue mix** knob
  between cue and master, and pick a **Phones out**: any output device the
  browser can reach, or the FLX4's own headphone jack, which is fed by the
  backend over USB ([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-flx4-phones-jack-via-a-backend-cue-sink.md)).

Settings (pad arrangements, volumes, crossfade) persist across reloads.
Shortcuts: `A`/`B` focus a deck's style-target input, `X` focuses the
crossfader.

For frontend development: `just dev-backend` in one terminal, `just
dev-frontend` in another (the Vite dev server proxies `/ws` to the backend).

## Hardware control (Pioneer DDJ-FLX4)

Plug in the FLX4 and click **Connect MIDI** (Chrome asks for MIDI with SysEx;
plain MIDI works too, minus position sync). Mapped controls:

- Play/pause, channel faders, three-band EQ, crossfader
- Channel **CUE** buttons (headphone cue) and the transport **CUE** button
  (deck prep: prime a stopped deck off-air, stop a playing one)
- **SMART CFX** knob — Color FX amount; hold **SHIFT** to sweep the style pad
  instead
- **PAD FX** pad bank — select the deck's effect (re-press toggles it off);
  **HOT CUE** pads pick style targets
- **HEADPHONES MIX** knob — cue mix

Knob and fader positions sync from the hardware on connect, and the LEDs
mirror app state. The measured byte map lives in
[`docs/midi-ddj-flx4.md`](docs/midi-ddj-flx4.md).

## Verify

- `just test` — backend pytest + frontend vitest
- `just lint` — format check, ruff, eslint, tsc
- `just check` — both of the above; what a PR must pass
- `just verify-stream` / `just verify-ui` — e2e against a running server
  (UI e2e needs Playwright Chromium once: `npx playwright install chromium`
  in `frontend/`)
- Hardware behaviour is verified by a human against the checklists in
  `docs/` (`m7-`, `m9-m10-`, `m12-hardware-checklist.md`)
