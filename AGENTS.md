# Engineering Standards

> `berlitz-engineering:code-reviewer` subagent, and the `/berlitz-engineering:pre-pr-check` gate.

## Definition of Done

A change is **done** only when every item holds. Treat these as the acceptance
criteria for every task; if you cannot verify one, say so explicitly rather
than reporting the change as complete.

- [ ] **Behaviour verified by running it** - not by inspection alone.
- [ ] **Tests cover it and the full suite is green.** New behaviour has tests;
      a bug fix has a test that fails without the fix.
- [ ] **Format, lint, type-check, and build pass** with no new warnings.
- [ ] **The diff is self-reviewed** - focused, minimal, nothing unrelated.
- [ ] **Docs and ADRs are updated** when behaviour or a significant decision
      changed.
- [ ] **No secrets committed; no obvious security or data-loss risk.**

Run **`/berlitz-engineering:pre-pr-check`** to verify this list before opening a pull request.

## Project conventions

<!-- Fill in only what the agent cannot infer from the code itself. Keep each
     line concrete and verifiable - "run `npm test`", not "test your work". -->

- Build / run / test: from `backend/`: `uv sync`, run with `uv run magenta-dj`,
  test with `uv run pytest`, format/lint with `uv run ruff format .` and
  `uv run ruff check .`
- Branch & PR naming: one branch per roadmap milestone or issue, kebab-case
  (e.g. `m1-one-deck-audible`)
- Gotchas: model weights live outside the repo in
  `~/Documents/Magenta/magenta-rt-v2` (override with `MAGENTA_HOME`); first
  run needs `uv run mrt models init` + `uv run mrt models download mrt2_small`.
  Only `backend/magenta_dj/engine.py` may import `magenta_rt` (ADR-0002);
  measured API facts are in `docs/spike-mrt2.md`

## Working with your agent here

The end-to-end process - idea → issue → plan → build → verify → PR - is written
up in [`docs/WORKFLOW.md`](docs/WORKFLOW.md). Start there if you're new.

- **`/berlitz-engineering:pre-pr-check`** - format → lint → build → test, then a standards review (add `--loop` to fix findings with you, re-review, and open the PR).
- **`write-adr`** skill - record a significant architectural decision (scaffolds the next numbered ADR).
- **`engineering-standards`** skill - the full team playbook (engineering
  principles, the testing deep-dive, reviews, architecture, quality); loads on
  demand.
- **`berlitz-engineering:code-reviewer`** subagent - reviews a diff against these standards.
- **`berlitz-engineering:architecture-reviewer`** subagent - reviews a plan before you build.

<!-- Project-specific guidance goes below this line: architecture overview,
     conventions unique to this codebase, anything a new contributor needs.
     The standards above are maintained centrally in ai-kit -
     re-run /berlitz-engineering:setup to pull updates. -->
