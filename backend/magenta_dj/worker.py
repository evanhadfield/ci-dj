"""Deck worker process: runs the generation loop around a DeckEngine.

Commands arrive on cmd_queue as dicts ({"type": "play" | "stop" |
"set_prompt" | "shutdown", ...}). Output goes to out_queue as
("audio", bytes) and ("status", dict) tuples.

Pacing: the model generates faster than real time, so the worker throttles
itself to stay TARGET_AHEAD_SECONDS ahead of wall-clock playback — enough
cushion to absorb a slow chunk, small enough that a prompt change is heard
within a few seconds. The bounded out_queue is only a safety net for a
stalled client.
