"""FastAPI controller: supervises deck workers and bridges them to WebSockets.

One WebSocket per deck at /ws/deck/{deck_id}: binary frames carry PCM chunks
(interleaved stereo float32 LE, 48 kHz — see docs/spike-mrt2.md), JSON text
frames carry control in both directions. The controller never touches
magenta_rt (ADR-0002); it only forwards between the worker queues and the
socket.
