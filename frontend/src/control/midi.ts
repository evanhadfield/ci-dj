/** Web MIDI plumbing for supported DJ controllers (ADR-0005, issue #30).
 * Framework-free so the connect/hot-plug/permission/selection flow is
 * unit-testable with a fake MIDIAccess; the React side lives in useMidi. The
 * link is device-agnostic: it matches connected ports against the injected
 * driver registry (one driver per controller — registry.ts), binds the active
 * device, and sends that driver's position-sync SysEx. Access is only
 * requested from an explicit user gesture — the browser permission prompt
 * should never appear unprompted.
 *
 * In the native shell (Phase 2) there is no browser Web MIDI: tauri-plugin-midi
 * injects `navigator.requestMIDIAccess` as a polyfill over midir/CoreMIDI at
 * webview startup (SysEx + output send included; ports poll every 1 s for
 * hot-plug). The single callsite below is that shim's target, so the same code
 * drives both transports. */
